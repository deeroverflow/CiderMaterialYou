//  Cider Material You theme (without the customisation) by deer#9999 / @deerwithacurl
//  since cider seems to compile the theme on launch, we can just use an import that will always pull the latest update from github
@import (less) "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deeroverflow/CiderMaterialYou/main/src/release.less";
