//  Cider Material You theme (without the customisation) by deer#9999 / @deerwithacurl
//  since cider seems to compile the theme on launch, we can just use an import that will always pull the latest update from github
@import (less) "https://deerwithacurl.github.io/CiderMaterialYou/src/release.less";
//  you can replace the contents of _variables with another generated one so long as you convert it away from css variables to less ones
